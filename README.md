# Adaptive-traffic-signal
This project proposes a novel traffic light control system powered by computer vision, leveraging live CCTV feeds and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time vehicle detection and classification. By dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings based on vehicle density and types, our system aims to optimize traffic flow, alleviate congestion, and mitigate the environmental impacts associated with prolonged idling.
